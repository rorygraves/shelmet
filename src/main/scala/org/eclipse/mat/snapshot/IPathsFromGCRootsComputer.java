 * Interface describing an interactive computer for paths from GC roots to an

 * <p/>
 * Finding paths from GC roots to an object is handy if you want to learn which
 * objects are responsible for the given object to remain in memory. Since the
 * snapshot implementation artificially creates references from the object to
 * its class and from the class to its class loader you can even see why a class
 * or class loader remains in memory, i.e. which other objects hold references
 * to objects of the class or class loader of interest.
